# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model
Developed a predictive machine-learning model to identify customers at high risk of churning using a real-world telecom/customer-behavior dataset. Performed extensive preprocessing including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling, and addressing class imbalance with SMOTE. Conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover key churn drivers such as contract type, service quality, tenure, and payment behavior. Implemented and compared multiple classification models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machines—achieving strong recall and improved accuracy for minority churn classes. Delivered feature-importance insights to support customer-retention strategies and data-driven business decisions.
